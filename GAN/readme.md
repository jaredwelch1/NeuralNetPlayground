# GAN

Generative Adversarial Networks are a neural network structure that takes two nets, one which is trained
to generate data from noise, and one which is trained to distinguish between generated images and real images.

Some reading about GANS: [original paper about
General Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) and a [paper about recent attempts with audio
data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04208?utm_source=mybridge&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=read_more))

Current modern of the art image manipulation and faceswapping generally uses GAN techniques. One caveat to consider is GANS
generally take quite a bit to train and can be difficult to get convergence.
